Bored Game is a RubyFX driven engine which allows users to play turn-based, 2D games either on a single computer or over a network.

Currently it can be used to play (and for which the game logic is complete):
* Noughts and Crosses (a.k.a. Tic-Tac-Toe)
* Hnefatafl (a.k.a. The Viking Game)
* Ludo.
* Shoggoth (a.k.a. Attaxx)
Each game type can be played on various size boards with various setups.

Future Developments:
Games such as Chess, Go, etc. would be relatively easy to add, working within the existing framework.
Future work will include implementing hex-based, isometric-view and/or province-based (e.g. Risk) boards.
Hopefully original game designs will be created for the engine. This also means that games which could not be played without a computer can be made.

There is no intention to program AI into the games. It would however, be
possible to do this by simply writing a robot which connected via TCP.
